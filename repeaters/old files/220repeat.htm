The Alford Memorial 220 Repeater was originally put on the air in 1992 for use by novice 
operators that did not have priviledges on the 2 m band.  
The Original 220 Tower site was at Memorial Drive at I-285 with the Antenna mounted at
about 70 ft.  On April 21, 2002 the repeater was moved to it's present home at the Exchange Park 
Tower location.  The Antenna was mounted at the 375ft level
