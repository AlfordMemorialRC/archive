<p>There are so many VE testing sessions around Atlanta and the state of Georgia that it has been become an almost
impossible task to keep up with the changes to all of the sessions that were previously listed on this page.
<br><br>
We now suggest that you visit the ARRL's Exam Session page at the following link:
<a href="http://www.arrl.org/exam_sessions/"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>http://www.arrl.org/exam_sessions</b></font></a>
<br><br>
Just enter your home ZIP Code into the search form and then select the number of miles from the drop down box
before clicking on the search button you will be presented with a large list of available sessions.

<p><font face="verdana" size="2"><b>General
information for exam
sessions "to get your Ticket".</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="2">The
administrative procedures of
most exam sessions are very similar to each other. The following
information should be applicable to all exam sessions in this listing.
However, it is advisable to check with the session coordinator to be
sure you have everything you need BEFORE you show up. </font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="2">Most all
of the sessions are
walk-in, i.e., there is no pre-registration required. </font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="2">Please
bring two (2) forms of
identification with you. One that includes a picture of the applicant
on the ID, like a drivers license or a student ID. The other form of
Identification needs to be proof of your Social Security number. </font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="2">Parents
should provide some form of
identification for non-driving minors. Social Security Card or number
will be needed. Other forms of acceptable ID include passports, library
cards with photo, or School Student ID. </font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="2"> There is
an administration fee for
most of the tests of about $15.00. It might be more or less depending
on the VE Group running the test. </font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="2">If you are
coming to a test session,
to take your first Technician Test. Bring yourself, your IDs, your
favorite pencil or pen, and your calculator. Leave your nervousness at
home because we want you to get your license. </font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="2">If you are
coming to upgrade your
license, bring your IDs and <b>both the originals and
photocopies of
your current amateur license and any Certificates proving credit from
previous exams that you have taken. </b> These will be needed to
show
completetion of prior exams for your upgrade.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="2">Calculators
are allowed, but you
must be able to show the examiner team that the memories of any
programmable calculators have been cleared before the exam starts. </font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="2">All needed
forms will be supplied by
the exam teams - it will not be necessary to bring an FCC form 610.
Pencils and scratch paper are provided at most of the sessions, but you
should probably have one pen or pencil of your own. </font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="2">You should
arrive at the exam site
at least 15 minutes before the exam is scheduled to start to begin
paperwork processing. No one will be admitted while a code exam is
being given and a code exam, once given, will usually not be repeated
that day, even if you are late. </font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="2">Please
keep in mind that the exam
team members are all volunteers and are donating their time to help you
obtain your license. They make every effort to be professional and
efficient in the exam process, but they ARE volunteers.<br>
<br>
We are blessed with more frequent test sessions here in Atlanta than
probably anywhere else in the country, so a lot of folks are putting in
their time. We enjoy doing it or we'd simply quit, but an occasional
"thanks" makes it that much more enjoyable. </font></p>
<p><b><font size="+1">FCC License Renewals
and FCC License Expiration
Notices </font></b></p>
<p> <font face="verdana" size="2">Amateurs
may renew their
FCC-issued licenses "on line" via the FCC web using <a href="http://wireless.fcc.gov/uls/index.htm?job=home">FCC ULS</a>. <br>
FCC permits on-line renewals at 90 days or less before a license will
expire. If a license is already expired, but is within the FCC's
two-year grace period for renewal, the FCC will not accept an on-line
application--but they will continue to accept Form 605 requests for
renewal when submitted by mail to: FCC, 1270 Fairfield Rd, Gettysburg
PA 17325-7245. </font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="2">Amateurs
may continue to renew their
licenses within 90 days before the license expiration date, or within
the two-year license grace period after expiration, using FCC Form 605
by mail to: FCC, 1270 Fairfield Rd, Gettysburg PA 17325-7245.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="2">The FCC
will be resuming their
mailing of notifications to amateurs just prior to their license
expiration. FCC-license renewals are FREE (no renewal charge or fee is
required by FCC). </font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="2">
Presently, expiration notices are
sent from ARRL HQ to ARRL Members only! <br>
These
ARRL-Member-only notices include a cover letter with instructions for
renewing electronically or by mail, an FCC Form 605 with instructions,
and an envelope addressed to FCC. ARRL Members may also choose to
forward their hardcopy, signed Forms 605 to HQ (to the ARRL/VEC,225
Main St, Newington CT 06111) and we will process them electronically
(this FREE service is for ARRL Members only!). </font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="2">Expiration
notices are also sent to
all amateurs from the W5YI Group in Dallas TX (a handling fee is charged
for their service).<br>
