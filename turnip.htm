<p>( THE REPEATER MUST BE CLEAR OF TRAFFIC BEFORE STARTING
<p>THE NET, THIS IS A MUST!! NO MATTER WHOM IT MY BE!!!! OR TILL THEIR
TRAFFIC IS COMPLETED!!!)
<p>It's midnight in Atlanta Ga. Is the repeater in use?
<p>Hearing no response, This is___callsign___, My name is___name___ and
I'll be Turnip Net Controller for tonight's net. As the presiding Turnip,
I'd like to welcome all travelers and visitor who may be listening. This
repeater is dedicated to the traveling ham. Any properly licensed stations
are cordially invited to join in anytime.
<p>Of course priority will always be given to any station with Emergency
Traffic. In a moment I'll begin taking check-ins for the Turnip Truck Net.
Listen carefully, Please check in By Saying; "This is" unkey wait for the
tone, Then continue with Your "Callsign", "Name", "Location", and if you
have any traffic. Please go slow I am a Turnip. If you are mobile, Low
power station or if you are located outside the Atlanta area please let
me know when you check in. Also even though this net is made up of turnips
and other vegetables, all stations are required to use good operating procedures.
Don't quick key leave room for other stations to join in or ask to use
the repeater.

<br>(Original Preamble)
<br>"Come Ye All Hams And Halfwits"
<br>Coming to you live from the Turnip Patch. This is the one and as
<br>far as we know, The only Turnip Truck Net. This is the saturday/friday
night
<br>calling of this world famous net and as long as we don't loose our
<br>sponsorship form the greater Snellville Turnip Juice Company,
<br>we will continue to bring this net to you saturday and friday night
at midnight.
<br>Most of our check-ins have IQs of less than 20 but if yours is more
<br>than 20 and you are having problems understanding or communicating
with
<br>the other check-ins this probably means you are to smart for the net.
<br>This net gives special recognition to all mental patients especially
<br>those with frontal lobotomies. We must caution you that once you have
<br>checked into this net you will be forever known as a Turnip.
<br>"WARNING" What you are about to hear are the voices of many happy but
<br>not so bright Turnips. (any new or old announcements)
<br>I'll now be taking Check-ins, remember please go slow.
<br>(See Check-in Procedures)
<br>Closing: I'd like to thank all fellow turnips for checking and the
<br>Alford Memorial Club for the use of the repeater. This net is
<br>off the air at ____time____. Returning the repeater back to
<br>abnormal use.
